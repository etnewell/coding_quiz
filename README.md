#Task
In this assignment I was tasked with creating an updating page based off the javascript to give a quiz.

#Working features
This page will present you with an opening page and 5 questions.
Each question has five diferent answers and only one will be correct.
This quiz takes a tally of your correct scores and allows you to log them in an array with your initials, allowing you to play over again without refreshing the page to get the perfect score.


#Challenges
I ran late on the assignment as I had to rewrite a couple times, and couldn't finish the css or the timer function
I had a hard time getting the page to update correctly and became confused as to the methodology I was supposed to use.
I still don't think that I did it the 'correct' way, but the main functionality of it is there.
